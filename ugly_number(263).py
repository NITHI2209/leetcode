#question
# An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.
# Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
